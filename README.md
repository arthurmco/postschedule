# postschedule

Stores social network posts for communication and propaganda for my
books and book universe.

## Working

It is just a collection of texts stored in a sqlite database.

When required, the program will copy the text into the clipboard abd
then the associated image, so you can paste both easily.

After that, you simply register a post done and it will be done.

## Use

Although I am using this for fb, X can be used in this way, too.
